## Tikal's Front-end group exam
This is an online code exam. You will receive 5 JS questions. Each question will require you to write a function and submit it. Each question will have a time limit and a maximum number of submission attempts.

Here are a few things to pay attention to:

1. Pay attention to the time remaining.
2. No imports are allowed.
3. You can add internal functions but the code submitted needs to be contained within the main function
4. Your code will be automatically tested so Be sure to cover edge cases to make sure all tests will complete successfully.
5. No IO operations are allowed
6. You can test your code locally before submitting if you wish to.
7. You __MUST__ complete the exam within one session. You will not be able to re-login.

*Good Luck!*
